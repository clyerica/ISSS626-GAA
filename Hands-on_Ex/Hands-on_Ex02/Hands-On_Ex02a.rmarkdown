# 1. Overview

**Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (SPPA)** is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution of a set of points on a surface. The points may represent:

-   events such as crimes, traffic accidents, or disease onsets, or
-   business services (e.g., coffee shops and fast-food outlets) or facilities such as childcare centres and eldercare centres.

First-order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis (1st-SPPA) focuses on understanding the *intensity* or *density* of points across a study area. It examines *how the distribution of points varies over space*, essentially identifying trends or patterns in point density. This type of analysis deals with the individual locations of points and their distribution, without considering interactions between them.

This page covers usage of **spatstat** to perform two commonly used 1st-SPAA methods, to answer the following questions:

-   Are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?
-   If the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?

# 2. The Data

To provide answers to the questions above, two data sets will be used. They are:

1.  *Child Care Services* data from data.gov.sg, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres.
2.  *Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)*, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2019 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data.

# 3. Installing and loading R packages

The R packages used in this exercise are as follows:

1.  **sf**, a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.
2.  **spatstat**, which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.
3.  **terra**: The terra package is a modern spatial data analysis package designed to replace the raster package. It offers improved speed and efficiency when working with both raster and vector spatial data, particularly with large datasets. terra provides functionalities for creating, reading, manipulating, and writing raster and vector data, and it’s built on top of GDAL and PROJ libraries for enhanced performance. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into terra format.
4.  **tmap** which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using leaflet API.
5.  **rvest** for scraping (or harvesting) data from web pages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, terra, spatstat, 
               tmap, rvest, tidyverse)
```

# 4 Importing and Wrangling the Geospatial Data sets

The following code chunk imports Master Plan 2019 Subzone (No Sea) dataset into R.

-    st_zm() removes Z (elevation) and M (measure) dimensions from geospatial geometries.

-   st_transform(crs=3414) transforms the projections to svy21

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read("data/MasterPlan2019SubzoneBoundaryNoSeaKML.kml") %>% 
  st_zm(drop = TRUE, what = "ZM") %>% st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

Next, the following code chunk builds the function extract_kml_field to extract REGION_N, PLN_AREA_N, SUBZONE_N, SUBZONE_C from the Description field.

```{r}
extract_kml_field <- function(html_text, field_name) {
  if (is.na(html_text) || html_text == "") return(NA_character_)
  
  page <- read_html(html_text)
  rows <- page %>% html_elements("tr")
  
  value <- rows %>%
    keep(~ html_text2(html_element(.x, "th")) == field_name) %>%
    html_element("td") %>%
    html_text2()
  
  if (length(value) == 0) NA_character_ else value
}
```

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- mpsz_sf %>%
  mutate(
    REGION_N = map_chr(Description, extract_kml_field, "REGION_N"),
    PLN_AREA_N = map_chr(Description, extract_kml_field, "PLN_AREA_N"),
    SUBZONE_N = map_chr(Description, extract_kml_field, "SUBZONE_N"),
    SUBZONE_C = map_chr(Description, extract_kml_field, "SUBZONE_C")
  ) %>%
  select(-Name, -Description) %>%
  relocate(geometry, .after = last_col())
```

The following code chunk filters the mpsz dataset to remove unnecessary rows (areas outside the main island of Singapore), then saves the filtered dataset mpsz_cl as an R object. This allows us to store the dataset for later use without needing to re-run the earlier data manipulation steps.

```{r}
mpsz_cl <- mpsz_sf %>%
  filter(SUBZONE_N != "SOUTHERN GROUP",
         PLN_AREA_N != "WESTERN ISLANDS",
         PLN_AREA_N != "NORTH-EASTERN ISLANDS")
```

```{r}
write_rds(mpsz_cl, 
          "data/mpsz_cl.rds")
```

Next, the following code chunk imports the Childcare Serice data as an sf data frame childcare_sf.

-   st_zm() removes Z (elevation) and M (measure) dimensions from geospatial geometries.

-   st_transform(crs=3414) transforms the projections to svy21

```{r}
childcare_sf <- st_read("data/ChildCareServices.geojson") %>% 
  st_zm(drop = TRUE, what = "ZM") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

The following code chunk checks that the imported data is in the correct projection (svy21).

```{r}
st_geometry(mpsz_cl)
st_geometry(childcare_sf)
```

## 4.1 Mapping geospatial data sets

After checking the referencing system of each geospatial data data frame, it is useful to plot a map to show the spatial patterns.

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape(mpsz_cl)+
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(childcare_sf) +
  tm_dots() 
```

All geospatial layers are within the same map extend, which shows that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to within a similar spatial context.

Alternatively, an interactive point symbol map can be prepared as in the following code chunk:

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_basemap(server = "http://a.tiles.wmflabs.org/bw-mapnik/{z}/{x}/{y}.png")
tm_shape(childcare_sf) +
  tm_dots() 
```

The below code chunk switches tmap back to plot mode after making an interactive map. This is because an interactive mode will consume a connection. Excessive numbers of interactive maps should be avoided within a single RMarkdown document when publishing on Netlify.

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
```

# 5. Geospatial Data Wrangling

**spatstat** relies on its own specific data structures like **ppp** (planar point pattern) for point data and **owin** for observation windows. This section will convert sf (Simple Features) objects into spatstat ppp and owin object.

## 5.1 Converting sf data frames to ppp class

**spatstat** requires the point event data in **ppp** object form. The code chunk below uses `as.ppp()` of **spatstat** package to convert `childcare_sf` to **ppp** format.

```{r}
childcare_ppp <- as.ppp(childcare_sf)
```

Next, `class()` of Base R will be used to verify the object class of `childcare_ppp`.

```{r}
class(childcare_ppp)
```

The summary statistic of the newly converted ppp object can be seen using the code chunk below

```{r}
summary(childcare_ppp)
```

## 5.2 Creating an owin object

When analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis with a geographical area, like Singapore boundary. In **spatstat**, an object called **owin** is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.

The code chunk below, `as.owin()` of **spatstat** is used to covert `mpsz_sf` into **owin** object of **spatstat**.

```{r}
sg_owin <- as.owin(mpsz_cl)
```

Again, `class()` will be used to verify the object class of `sg_owin`.

```{r}
class(sg_owin)
```

`sg_owin` object can be displayed by using `plot()` function.

```{r}
plot(sg_owin)
```

## 5.3 Combining point events object and owin object

In this last step of geospatial data wrangling, we will extract childcare events that are located within Singapore by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp = childcare_ppp[sg_owin]
```

The output object combined both the point and polygon feature in one ppp object class as shown below.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp

```

```{r}
childcare_ppp
```

Comparing both objects, we can see that the polygon feature has been changed

# 6 Clark-Evan Test for Nearest Neighbour Analysis

**Nearest Neighbor Analysis (NNA)** is a spatial statistics method that calculates the average distance between each point and its closest neighbor to determine if a pattern of points is clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed.

Clark-Evans test is a specific statistical method used within NNA to quantify whether a point pattern is clustered, random, or uniformly spaced, using the Clark-Evans aggregation index (R) to describe this pattern. NNA provides a numerical value that describes the degree of clustering or regularity, and the Clark-Evans test calculates a specific index (R) for this purpose.

::: callout-note
NNA is a broad term for methods that examine the spatial distribution of points, whereas the Clark-Evans test is a specific statistical method used within NNA to quantify whether a point pattern is clustered, random, or uniformly spaced, using the Clark-Evans aggregation index (R) to describe this pattern. NNA provides a numerical value that describes the degree of clustering or regularity, and the Clark-Evans test calculates a specific index (R) for this purpose.
:::

In this section, we will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation for a spatial point pattern by using `clarkevans.test()` of **spatstat.explore** package.

The test hypotheses are:

-   Ho = The distribution of childcare services are randomly distributed.
-   H1 = The distribution of childcare services are not randomly distributed.

The 95% confident interval will be used.

## 6.1 Performing the Clark-Evans test without CSR

`clarkevans.test()` of spatstat.explore package support two Clark-Evans test, namely: without CRS and with CRS. In the code chunk below, Clark-Evans test without CSR method is used.

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcareSG_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion="sg_owin",
                alternative=c("clustered"))
```

[Conclusion]{.underline}: as P value is \<0.05, at the 95% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of childcare services is randomly distributed. As the R value is less than 1, this indicates clustering.

[Recommendation]{.underline}: Given that the distribution of childcare services demonstrates clustering, it would be beneficial to supplement this finding with demographic data in regions with and without clusters of childcare services. This could potentially allow us to discover areas where there is oversupply or undersupply of childcare services.

# 6.2 Performing the Clark-Evans test with CSR

In the code chunk below, the argument method = “MonteCarlo” is used. In this case, the p-value for the test is computed by comparing the observed value of R to the results obtained from nsim (i.e. 39, 99, 999) simulated realisations of Complete Spatial Randomness conditional on the observed number of points.

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcareSG_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion="sg_owin",
                alternative=c("clustered"),
                method="MonteCarlo",
                nsim=99)
```

Conclusion: as P value is = 0.01, at the 95% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis that the distribution of childcare services is randomly distributed. As the R value is less than 1, this indicates clustering.

# 7. Kernel Density Estimation Method:

**Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)** is a valuable tool for visualising and analyzing first-order spatial point patterns. It is widely considered a method within **Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)** because it’s used to visualize and understand spatial data patterns by transforms discrete point data (like locations of childcare service, crime incidents or disease cases) into continuous density surfaces that reveal clusters and variations in event occurrences, without making prior assumptions about data distribution. It helps to begin understanding data distribution, identify hotspots, and explore relationships between spatial variables before performing more rigorous analysis.

This section will compute the kernel density estimation (KDE) of childcare services in Singapore.

## 7.1 Working with automatic bandwidth selection method

The code chunk below computes a kernel density by using the following configurations of `density()` of **spatstat**:

-   `bw.diggle()` automatic bandwidth selection method. Other recommended methods are `bw.CvL()`, `bw.scott()` or `bw.ppl()`.
-   The smoothing kernel used is gaussian, which is the default. Other smoothing methods are: “epanechnikov”, “quartic” or “disc”.
-   The intensity estimate is corrected for edge effect bias by using method described by Jones (1993) and Diggle (2010, equation 18.9). The default is FALSE.

```{r}
kde_SG_diggle <- density(
  childcareSG_ppp,
  sigma=bw.diggle,
  edge=TRUE,
  kernel="gaussian") 
```

The output of `density()` of spatstat is an **im** class, represents a two-dimensional pixel image. It’s a class used to store and manipulate raster data, where the spatial domain is divided into a grid of rectangular pixels. Each pixel has an associated value, which can be numerical or a factor.

The `plot()` function of Base R is then used to display the kernel density derived.

```{r}
plot(kde_SG_diggle)
```

`summary()` of Base R is used to print the summary report of the kernel density.

```{r}
summary(kde_SG_diggle)
```

The range of density of the output is too small to comprehend as the default unit of measurement in svy21 is in meters. Hence, the density value is computed as 'number of points per square meter'.

The bandwidth used to compute the kde layer can be retrieved with the following code chunk.

```{r}
bw<- bw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp)
bw
```

## 7.2 Rescaling KDE values

In the code chunk below, `rescale.ppp()` is used to covert the unit of measurement from meter to kilometer.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp_km <- rescale.ppp(
  childcareSG_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

Now, we can re-run `density()` using the resale data set and plot the output kde map.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_km <- density(childcareSG_ppp_km,
                              sigma=bw.diggle,
                              edge=TRUE,
                              kernel="gaussian")
```

Next, `plot()` is used to plot the kde object as shown below.

```{r}
plot(kde_childcareSG_km)
```

## 7.3 Working with different automatic bandwidth methods

Beside `bw.diggle()`, there are three other spatstat functions can be used to determine the bandwidth, they are: `bw.CvL()`, `bw.scott()`, and `bw.ppl()`.

Let us take a look at the bandwidth return by these automatic bandwidth calculation methods by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
bw.CvL(childcareSG_ppp_km)
```

```{r}
bw.scott(childcareSG_ppp_km)
```

```{r}
bw.ppl(childcareSG_ppp_km)
```

```{r}
bw.diggle(childcareSG_ppp_km)
```

Baddeley et. (2016) suggested the use of the `bw.ppl()` algorithm because past experience shown that it tends to produce the more appropriate values when the pattern consists predominantly of tight clusters. But they also insist that if the purpose of once study is to detect a single tight cluster in the midst of random noise then the `bw.diggle()` method seems to work best.

The code chunk below will be used to compare the output of using bw.diggle and bw.ppl methods.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG.ppl <- density(childcareSG_ppp_km, 
                               sigma=bw.ppl, 
                               edge=TRUE,
                               kernel="gaussian")
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_childcareSG_km, main = "bw.diggle")
plot(kde_childcareSG.ppl, main = "bw.ppl")
```

## Working with difference kernel methods

By default, the kernel method used in `density.ppp()` is gaussian. But there are three other options, namely: Epanechnikov, Quartic and Dics.

The code chunk below will be used to compute three more kernel density estimations by using these three kernel function.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(density(childcareSG_ppp_km, 
             sigma=0.2959712, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="gaussian"), 
     main="Gaussian")
plot(density(childcareSG_ppp_km, 
             sigma=0.2959712, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="epanechnikov"), 
     main="Epanechnikov")
plot(density(childcareSG_ppp_km, 
             sigma=0.2959712, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="quartic"), 
     main="Quartic")
plot(density(childcareSG_ppp_km, 
             sigma=0.2959712, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="disc"), 
     main="Disc")
```

# 8 Fixed and Adaptive KDE

## 8.1 Computing KDE using fixed bandwidth

Next, the KDE layer will be computed by defining a bandwidth of 600 meter. Notice that in the code chunk below, the sigma value used is 0.6. This is because the unit of measurement of **childcareSG_ppp_km** object is in kilometer, hence the 600m is 0.6km.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_fb <- density(childcareSG_ppp_km,
                              sigma=0.6, 
                              edge=TRUE,
                              kernel="gaussian")
plot(kde_childcareSG_fb)
```

## 8.2 Computing KDE using adaptive bandwidth

Fixed bandwidth method is very sensitive to highly skewed distribution of spatial point patterns over geographical units. For example, urban versus rural. One way to overcome this problem is by using adaptive bandwidth instead.

In this section, adaptive kernel density estimation will be derived using `density.adaptive()` of **spatstat**.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_ab <- adaptive.density(
  childcareSG_ppp_km, 
  method="kernel")
plot(kde_childcareSG_ab)
```

We can compare the fixed and adaptive kernel density estimation outputs by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_childcareSG_fb, main = "Fixed bandwidth")
plot(kde_childcareSG_ab, main = "Adaptive bandwidth")
```

# 9 Plotting cartographic quality KDE map

## 9.1 Converting gridder output into raster

Next, we will convert the im kernel density objects into **SpatRaster** object using `rast()` of **terra** package

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_bw_terra <- rast(kde_childcareSG_km)
```

`class()` is used to verify whether **kde_childcareSG_bw_terra** data is of the **SpatRaster** class

```{r}
class(kde_childcareSG_bw_terra)
```

The properties of **kde_childcareSG_bw_terra** are displayed below

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_bw_terra
```

The crs property is empty.

## 9.2 Assigning projection systems

In the code chunk below, `crs()` of terra is used to assign the CRS information on the **kde_childcareSG_bw_terra** layer.

```{r}
crs(kde_childcareSG_bw_terra) <- "EPSG:3414"
```

Now, viewing the properties of the **kde_childcareSG_bw_terra** RasterLayer, the crs is in **SVY21**.

```{r}
kde_childcareSG_bw_terra
```

## 9.3 Plotting KDE map with tmap

The following code chunk displays the raster in cartographic quality map using the **tmap** package.

```{r}
tm_shape(kde_childcareSG_bw_terra) + 
  tm_raster(col.scale = 
              tm_scale_continuous(
                values = "viridis"),
            col.legend = tm_legend(
            title = "Density values",
            title.size = 0.7,
            text.size = 0.7,
            bg.color = "white",
            bg.alpha = 0.7,
            position = tm_pos_in(
              "right", "bottom"),
            frame = TRUE)) +
  tm_graticules(labels.size = 0.7) +
  tm_compass() +
  tm_layout(scale = 1.0)
```

# 10. First Order SPAA at the Planning Subzone Level

In this section, we would like to further our analysis at the planning area level. For simplicity reason, we will focus on Punggol, Tampines Chua Chu Kand and Jurong West planning areas.

## 10.1 Geospatial data wrangling

### 10.1.1 Extracting study area

The code chunk below will be used to extract the target planning areas.

```{r}
pg <- mpsz_cl %>%
  filter(PLN_AREA_N == "PUNGGOL")
tm <- mpsz_cl %>%
  filter(PLN_AREA_N == "TAMPINES")
ck <- mpsz_cl %>%
  filter(PLN_AREA_N == "CHOA CHU KANG")
jw <- mpsz_cl %>%
  filter(PLN_AREA_N == "JURONG WEST")
```

As a good practice, we should review the extracted areas. the code chunk below plots the extracted planning areas.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(st_geometry(pg), main = "Ponggol")
plot(st_geometry(tm), main = "Tampines")
plot(st_geometry(ck), main = "Choa Chu Kang")
plot(st_geometry(jw), main = "Jurong West")
```

### 10.1.2 Creating owin object

Next, we will convert these sf objects into owin objects as required by spatstat.

```{r}
pg_owin = as.owin(pg)
tm_owin = as.owin(tm)
ck_owin = as.owin(ck)
jw_owin = as.owin(jw)
```

### 10.1.3 Combining point and owin objects

```{r}
childcare_pg_ppp = childcare_ppp[pg_owin]
childcare_tm_ppp = childcare_ppp[tm_owin]
childcare_ck_ppp = childcare_ppp[ck_owin]
childcare_jw_ppp = childcare_ppp[jw_owin]
```

Next, `rescale.ppp()` function is used to transform the unit of measurement from metre (svy21 default) to kilometre

```{r}
childcare_pg_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_pg_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_tm_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_tm_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_ck_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_ck_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_jw_ppp.km = rescale.ppp(childcare_jw_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

The code chunk below is used to plot these four study areas and the locations of the childcare centres.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(unmark(childcare_pg_ppp.km), 
  main="Punggol")
plot(unmark(childcare_tm_ppp.km), 
  main="Tampines")
plot(unmark(childcare_ck_ppp.km), 
  main="Choa Chu Kang")
plot(unmark(childcare_jw_ppp.km), 
  main="Jurong West")
```

## 10.2 Clark-Evans Test

In the code chunk below, `clarkevans.test()` of **spatstat** is used to performs Clark-Evans test of aggregation for childcare centre in each planning area.

### 10.2.1 Choa Chu Kang planning area

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcare_ck_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"))
```

### 10.2.2 Tampines planning area

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcare_tm_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"))
```

### 10.2.3 Punggol planning area

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcare_pg_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"))
```

### 10.2.4 Jurong West planning area

```{r}
clarkevans.test(childcare_jw_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"))
```

## 10.3 Computing KDE surfaces by planning area

The code chunk below will be used to compute the KDE of these four planning area. `bw.diggle` method is used to derive the bandwidth of each

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(density(childcare_pg_ppp.km, 
             sigma=bw.diggle, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="gaussian"),
     main="Punggol")
plot(density(childcare_tm_ppp.km, 
             sigma=bw.diggle, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="gaussian"),
     main="Tempines")
plot(density(childcare_ck_ppp.km, 
             sigma=bw.diggle, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="gaussian"),
     main="Choa Chu Kang")
plot(density(childcare_jw_ppp.km, 
             sigma=bw.diggle, 
             edge=TRUE, 
             kernel="gaussian"),
     main="Jurong West")
```
